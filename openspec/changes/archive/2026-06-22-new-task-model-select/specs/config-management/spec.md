## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-backend model option list

A backend configuration entry MAY carry an optional `models` list naming the model identifiers offered for that backend in the new-task model selector. When a backend's `models` list is non-empty it SHALL override the built-in curated list for that backend; when it is empty or absent the built-in curated list (keyed on the backend command) SHALL apply. The built-in defaults SHALL stay configuration-free: a fresh, unconfigured instance SHALL still offer per-backend model options for recognized backends (Claude, Codex) without any `models` entry.

#### Scenario: Configured models override the built-in list

- **WHEN** a backend entry declares a non-empty `models` list
- **THEN** the new-task model selector for that backend offers exactly those models (plus the always-present `default` and `custom…` options)

#### Scenario: Absent models falls back to built-ins

- **WHEN** a backend entry omits `models` and its command is a recognized built-in backend
- **THEN** the new-task model selector offers that backend's built-in curated model list
