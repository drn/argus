# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Argus is a terminal-native LLM code orchestrator built with Go + tcell/tview. It manages multiple Claude Code / Codex sessions with task tracking, git worktree isolation, and keyboard-driven workflow.

## Build & Run

```bash
make build                  # go build ./...
make vet                    # go vet ./...
make test                   # go test -race -count=1 ./...
make test-pkg PKG=./internal/db/  # single package, verbose
make test-cover             # coverage profile + summary
make test-watch             # gotestsum --watch (install: go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@latest)
go build -o argus ./cmd/argus/    # build binary
```

## Test-Driven Development

Follow Red-Green-Refactor as the default workflow:
1. **Red** — Write a failing test first using `internal/testutil` assertions
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code to make it pass
3. **Refactor** — Clean up while keeping tests green

Use `make test-watch` for continuous feedback. Use `make test-pkg` for focused iteration on a single package.

**Assertions** — use `internal/testutil` (not raw `if got != want`):
```go
import "github.com/drn/argus/internal/testutil"

testutil.Equal(t, got, want)           // comparable types
testutil.DeepEqual(t, got, want)       // structs/slices via go-cmp
testutil.NoError(t, err)               // err == nil
testutil.ErrorIs(t, err, target)       // errors.Is
testutil.Nil(t, val)                   // handles nil-interface trap
testutil.Contains(t, s, substr)        // string contains
```

All table-driven tests must use `t.Run` subtests. Guard slow tests with `testing.Short()`.

## Architecture

**tcell/tview UI** with direct cell painting for the agent terminal pane. The `App` struct owns the `tview.Application`, DB, runner, and all sub-views.

- `cmd/argus/main.go` — Entry point. Parses subcommands (`daemon`, `daemon stop`), opens SQLite database. In TUI mode: tries daemon client first, falls back to in-process runner. Starts the tcell/tview app.
- `internal/tui/app.go` — **Top-level tview application**. Owns all sub-views and routes key events via `tapp.SetInputCapture()`. View switching via `tview.Pages`. Layout uses `tview.Flex` (vertical: header + pages + statusbar).
- `internal/tui/tasklist.go` — Task list with collapsible project folders, cursor, scrolling, filtering. Tasks are grouped by project name into a flattened row list (project headers + task rows). Only one project is expanded at a time — auto-expands when the cursor enters a project, auto-collapses others. Cursor navigation skips project header rows entirely. Includes an **Archive section** at the bottom — the archive auto-expands when the cursor enters it and auto-collapses when the cursor leaves. Archived projects are only displayed within the archive section, never in the main section.
- `internal/tui/terminalpane.go` — Custom `tview.Box` widget for the agent terminal. Feeds PTY bytes to an x/vt emulator and paints cells directly to `tcell.Screen` via `paintVT()`. Supports live mode (incremental byte feeding), scrollback (x/vt native `Scrollback()` buffer), and log replay for finished sessions. Damage tracking via `Touched()` for efficient incremental repainting.
- `internal/tui/gitstatus.go` — `GitPanel` for git status/diff/branch display in both agent view and task list.
- `internal/tui/fileexplorer.go` — `FilePanel` with auto-expand, cursor navigation, and status icons.
- `internal/tui/reviews.go` — Reviews tab: three-panel layout (PR list / diff / comments) with GitHub API integration.
- `internal/tui/settings.go` — Settings tab with sections for status, sandbox, projects, backends, KB, and UX logs.
- `internal/tui/newtaskform.go` — New task form as modal overlay via `tview.Pages.AddPage`.
- `internal/tui/taskpage.go` — Task list page wrapper with three-panel layout (tasks | git+preview | details) and empty-state banner.
- `internal/app/agentview/` — Runtime-agnostic agent view state: `State`, `Panel`, `DiffState`, `TerminalAdapter` interface, `SessionLookup`.
- `internal/model/` — Core domain types. `Task` struct and `Status` enum with `pending → in_progress → in_review → complete` workflow. Status implements `encoding.TextMarshaler` for JSON serialization.
- `internal/db/` — SQLite-backed persistence at `~/.argus/data.sql`. Stores tasks, projects, backends, and config in a single database. Thread-safe with mutex. Seeds defaults on first run.
- `internal/config/config.go` — Config struct types and defaults. Struct types (`Config`, `Backend`, `Project`, `Keybindings`, `UIConfig`) are used throughout the codebase as value types. The `db.DB.Config()` method assembles a `Config` from the database.
- `internal/agent/` — Agent process management with PTY:
  - `agent.go` — Backend resolution and command building (`BuildCmd`). Supports `--session-id` for conversation pinning.
  - `worktree.go` — Git worktree creation under `~/.argus/worktrees/<project>/<task>` with `argus/<task>` branch naming.
  - `iface.go` — `SessionProvider` (manages sessions) and `SessionHandle` (single session) interfaces. UI code depends only on these interfaces, enabling both in-process and daemon-backed implementations.
  - `session.go` — PTY-backed process session via `creack/pty`. Single `readLoop` goroutine tees output to ring buffer + all attached writers. Multi-writer support via `AddWriter`/`RemoveWriter` for fan-out to multiple consumers. Supports attach/detach without stopping the process.
  - `runner.go` — Multi-session manager keyed by task ID. Implements `SessionProvider`. Start/Stop/Get/Attach/Detach. Auto-cleans up on process exit, fires `onFinish` callback.
  - `attach.go` — `AttachCmd` for full-screen terminal attach. Sets raw terminal mode, resizes PTY, uses detachReader to intercept `ctrl+q` for detach.
  - `ringbuffer.go` — Exported `RingBuffer` — fixed-size circular buffer for output replay on reattach. Used by both in-process sessions and daemon client's local buffer.
  - `errors.go` — Sentinel errors.
- `internal/daemon/` — Daemon architecture for persistent agent sessions:
  - `daemon.go` — `Daemon` struct: owns Runner, accepts Unix socket connections, dispatches RPC vs stream (first byte 'R'/'S'). PID file at `~/.argus/daemon.pid`. Signal handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT → graceful shutdown).
  - `types.go` — Shared RPC request/response types (`StartReq`, `SessionInfo`, `StreamHeader`, etc.).
  - `rpc.go` — `RPCService` implementing JSON-RPC methods: Ping, StartSession, StopSession, StopAll, SessionStatus, ListSessions, WriteInput, Resize, Shutdown.
  - `stream.go` — Output streaming handler. Client sends `StreamHeader` JSON, daemon calls `AddWriter(conn)` on the session. Raw bytes flow until session exit or client disconnect.
- `internal/uxlog/` — UX debug logging for the TUI layer. Writes to `~/.argus/ux.log`, separate from daemon logs. Logs task start/stop/finish, status transitions, stream connect/disconnect, RPC timeouts. Viewable in Settings → UX Logs.
- `internal/daemon/client/` — TUI-side daemon client:
  - `client.go` — `Client` implementing `SessionProvider` via JSON-RPC to daemon. Manages `RemoteSession` lifecycle.
  - `handle.go` — `RemoteSession` implementing `SessionHandle`. Local `RingBuffer` populated by stream reader. RPC calls for WriteInput, Resize, PTYSize, etc.
  - `stream.go` — Goroutine reads raw bytes from daemon stream connection into local ring buffer.
- `internal/gitutil/` — Git operations, diff parsing, changed files. Pure Go with no UI dependencies. Used by tui for git status, file diffs, and worktree management.
- `internal/spinner/` — Reusable spinner animation definitions. Each `Spinner` has a `Style`, `Label`, `Frames` (rune slice), and `TickInterval`. Built-in styles: Progress (nerdfont ee06–ee0b, 100ms), Dots (braille dots, 100ms), Braille (braille pattern, 100ms), Classic (ASCII, 150ms). Configurable via `ui.spinner` setting. `model.SetActiveSpinner()` switches at runtime; `model.SpinnerFrame(tick)` delegates to the active spinner.
- `internal/skills/` — Skill loading for autocomplete. Scans `~/.claude/skills/` and project-specific skill directories.
- `internal/vault/` — Vault file watcher for auto-task creation. Uses fsnotify to watch the Argus vault directory for new `.md` files, auto-creates tasks via `HeadlessCreateTask`. Debounces iCloud sync. Wired into daemon lifecycle.
- `internal/api/` — HTTP REST API for remote control. Bearer token auth, CORS, task CRUD, output viewing, PTY input, SSE streaming. Binds `0.0.0.0` for Tailscale access. Port-probing pattern from MCP server.
- `internal/daemon/headless.go` — Headless task creation (worktree + DB + session start) without TUI. Shared by vault watcher and HTTP API via `TaskCreator` function injection.

**Key pattern:** Sub-views are custom `tview.Box` widgets with `Draw(screen tcell.Screen)` methods. Async updates via `tapp.QueueUpdateDraw()` from the tick goroutine. Key routing via `tapp.SetInputCapture()`. **Every custom widget that accepts text input must implement `PasteHandler()`** — tview's bracket paste bypasses `InputCapture` entirely, so widgets without a `PasteHandler()` silently drop pasted text. For PTY-backed widgets, wrap the pasted text in bracket paste sequences (`\x1b[200~`/`\x1b[201~`).

**Agent pattern:** A single `readLoop` goroutine is the sole reader of the PTY master fd. It always writes to the ring buffer, and tees output to all attached writers (via `session.writers` slice). Writers are copied under lock before iterating; errored writers are removed automatically. `AddWriter(w)` replays the ring buffer then registers for live output. `Attach()`/`Detach()` use AddWriter/RemoveWriter internally. The detach key (`ctrl+q`) is intercepted by `detachReader` wrapping stdin.

**Terminal rendering:** PTY bytes → x/vt emulator (`charmbracelet/x/vt`) → cells painted directly to `tcell.SetContent()`. No ANSI string intermediary. Damage tracking via `Touched()` enables incremental repainting. Scrollback uses x/vt's native `Scrollback()` buffer. The cursor is rendered unconditionally with high-contrast colors regardless of `CursorVisible()`.

**Daemon pattern:** The daemon (`argus daemon`) owns the Runner and PTY sessions. The TUI connects via Unix socket (`~/.argus/daemon.sock`). First byte on each connection selects the protocol: 'R' for JSON-RPC (request/response), 'S' for output streaming (raw bytes). The TUI's `Client` implements `SessionProvider` so the UI code is identical whether running in-process or via daemon. Sessions survive TUI restarts — the daemon keeps PTY fds alive until explicit stop or shutdown. The TUI auto-starts the daemon if none is running: `autoStartDaemon()` forks the current binary with `Setsid` for process group detachment, then polls the socket until ready (50ms intervals, 3s timeout). Falls back to in-process mode if auto-start fails, with a warning shown in the Settings tab.

**Task/worktree lifecycle:** All fresh-task creation routes through `agent.CreateAndStart` (headless vault watcher + HTTP API + MCP via `daemon.HeadlessCreateTask`; TUI new-task form, launch-todo, reviews, fork directly). It runs in a single goroutine and is fully transactional: CreateWorktree → optional `OnWorktreeCreated` hook (fork context files) → `db.Add` → SessionID generation → `runner.Start` → flip to InProgress. Each side-effecting step registers a LIFO compensating cleanup, so any failure unwinds every prior step — no orphan worktrees, branches, or ghost DB rows. On name conflict, `CreateWorktree` auto-suffixes with `-1`, `-2`, etc. `startSession` in the TUI is reserved for *existing-task restart* (Enter-to-restart, auto-start on agent-view entry); on failure it reverts status but preserves the row, because the task already existed. On delete/destroy: stops agent → `agent.RemoveWorktreeAndBranch(path, branch, repoDir)` removes worktree (via `git worktree remove` from repoDir) → deletes local + remote branch → removes from DB.

**Git status pattern:** Git operations (worktree discovery, diff, status) must **never** run synchronously on the UI thread. Git commands run in background goroutines and deliver results via `QueueUpdateDraw` callbacks. Resolved paths are cached to avoid repeated lookups.

## Config & Persistence

- Data dir: `~/.argus/`
- Database: SQLite (`data.sql`) via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO)
- Backends are command templates with prompt flag interpolation, not SDK integrations

## Breaking Changes Policy

- Only one user (the author) — breaking changes are fine, no backwards compatibility needed
- No legacy migration code — if a schema change requires data migration, write a one-off script
- `internal/store/` (legacy JSON persistence) and `config.toml` support have been removed

## Key Learnings

Non-obvious invariants and gotchas are in `context/knowledge/gotchas/`. **Read the relevant file when working in that area** — they are NOT loaded automatically to save context window space.

@context/knowledge/index.md

### Maintaining Key Learnings

**What belongs in gotcha files:**
- Invariants that caused bugs when violated (e.g., "must do X before Y or Z breaks")
- Non-obvious ordering requirements, race conditions, platform quirks
- Gotchas where the obvious approach silently fails

**What does NOT belong:**
- Architecture descriptions (what code does) — put in the Architecture section above
- Feature descriptions (UI layout, key bindings, panel structure) — discoverable from code
- Development rules (testing, logging, documentation) — put in dedicated sections of CLAUDE.md
- Implementation details that are clear from reading the function

**Format:** Each entry is 1-2 sentences: the rule in bold, then minimal context. Add to the appropriate topic file in `context/knowledge/gotchas/`. If no file fits, add to `gotchas/misc.md`. If a section in `misc.md` grows beyond 10 bullets, promote it to its own file.

### Documentation Requirements

- **Every new feature must have its gotchas documented** in the appropriate `context/knowledge/gotchas/*.md` file before the session ends — but only the non-obvious gotchas, not a description of what the feature does.
- **What to document:** invariants that caused bugs, ordering requirements, platform quirks, silent failure modes. NOT: what the code does, feature descriptions, or UI layout.
- **Update README.md when adding user-facing features.** New features, configuration options, API endpoints, and keybindings must be documented in the appropriate README section before the session ends. If a feature changes how users interact with Argus, the README must reflect it.

### Logging Requirements

- **Every new feature must include uxlog calls for debugging.** All async handlers that process results from external systems (GitHub API, git commands, daemon RPC, etc.) must log both success and failure paths via `uxlog.Log("[feature] ...")`. Use a consistent prefix per feature area (e.g., `[reviews]`, `[git]`, `[daemon]`).
- **What to log:** fetch results (count/size), errors, state transitions, and any guards that silently skip work (e.g., cooldown timers, staleness checks).

### Testing Requirements

- **Every change must include tests.** Run `make test` to verify all tests pass before considering work complete.
- **Run `make test-cover` after writing tests** to verify coverage improved. Aim for ≥80% on packages you touch.
- **All table-driven tests must use `t.Run` subtests.** Guard slow tests with `testing.Short()`.
- **Test file placement:** `*_test.go` in the same package (not `_test` suffix). Use existing `testDB(t)` helpers.
- **What to test:** exported functions, pure logic (parsers, state transitions), view/render output, edge cases (nil, empty, boundaries), state machines.
- **OK to skip:** real terminal functions (raw mode, ioctl), external process shelling, `cmd/argus/main.go`.
- **Testing patterns:** `db.OpenInMemory()`, `agent.NewRunner(nil)`, `exec.Command("echo")` / `exec.Command("sleep")`, `DefaultTheme()`, table-driven with `t.Run`. Keep daemon client test names short (macOS 104-byte socket path limit).
- **CRITICAL: Tests must NEVER operate on real `~/.argus/` paths.** All worktree paths, data dirs, and file operations in tests MUST use `t.TempDir()`. A runtime `testGuard` in `internal/agent/cleanup.go` blocks deletions on real `~/.argus/` during `go test` as a safety net, but tests should be designed correctly in the first place.
- **Tests that exercise `agent.CreateAndStart` or anything that calls `WorktreeDir()` / `db.DataDir()` MUST `t.Setenv("HOME", t.TempDir())` before the call.** These helpers resolve through `$HOME`, so without the override they write to the real `~/.argus/worktrees/`. `testGuard` also exempts paths under `os.TempDir()` for exactly this case, so the HOME redirect is compatible with the safety net.
- **CRITICAL: Tests must NEVER connect to or affect the live argus daemon.** Use `agent.NewRunner(nil)` (not a real daemon client). Never dial the Unix socket (`~/.argus/daemon.sock`). Never send signals to the daemon PID.
- **Any change to tview screen setup (SetScreen, EnablePaste, EnableMouse, screen wrapping) must include a SimulationScreen integration test** verifying the feature works end-to-end. See `internal/tui/smoke_test.go` for the pattern: `simApp(t)` creates a `lazyScreen`-wrapped SimulationScreen with correct Enable ordering; `wireApp(t, app)` wires a full `App` to a SimulationScreen for smoke tests; `runApp(t, app)` manages the event loop lifecycle.
- **Major UI paths (tab switching, modal open/close, paste, agent view enter/exit) must have smoke tests** in `smoke_test.go` that exercise the real tview event loop. These catch setup-ordering bugs and event routing regressions that unit tests on individual handlers miss.
- **Every page wrapper or layout container with non-interactive child panels must have a `MouseHandler` that guards `setFocus`.** tview's default `Box.MouseHandler()` steals focus on click. Non-interactive panels (no `InputHandler`) silently drop all keyboard input when focused. The fix is to wrap `setFocus` in the page's `MouseHandler` to always redirect to the interactive panel. See `TaskPage.MouseHandler()` and `ToDosView.MouseHandler()` for the pattern. **Any new page wrapper must include a `TestSmoke_Click*` test** that injects a mouse click on a non-interactive area and verifies focus stays on the intended widget.
